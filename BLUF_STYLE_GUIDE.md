# BLUF Style Guide (from USF LIS 6107 - Advanced Professional Communication)

## BLUF Formula
1. **Bottom line** (one or two sentences; include timeframe + confidence)
2. **Why** (2-4 key drivers/evidence)
3. **Implications/so-what** (mission, risk, options, watch-fors)
4. **Indicators** (what would raise/lower confidence)

## Sentence Starters
- "We assess..."
- "It is likely/unlikely...within [timeframe]..."
- "This matters because..."
- "If X, then Y."

## Quick BLUF Template
**BLUF:** We assess that **[event/outcome]** is **[likely/unlikely, timeframe]** because **[driver 1/2/3]**.
**Implications:** **[operational/policy/mission impacts]**.
**Confidence:** **[high/mod/low]** due to **[source quality, gaps, alternative explanations]**.
**Indicators to Watch:** **[X rises/falls] -> increase/decrease likelihood**.

## Key Principles
- Intelligence writing exists to **support decisions**, not to showcase research
- Lead with a clear **judgment about what it means and what comes next**, then back it up
- **Future > Past**: Forecast and implications over long narrative background
- **Conclusions first**: No method/lit-review openers; save detail for annexes
- **Generalist audience**: Clarity, brevity, relevance > exhaustive detail
- Synthesize; don't "data-dump"
- Do NOT prescribe policy; assess and inform

## Confidence Marking (ICD 203)
- Use **High/Moderate/Low** with a short reason
- Example: "High - convergent SIGINT + GEOINT; minimal contradictory reporting"
- Offer **1-2 plausible alternatives** and the **indicator** that would favor each

## Helpful Phrases
- "Net assessment:" / "Bottom line:"
- "Near-term (0-3 mo): ... / Mid-term (3-12 mo): ..."
- "Key uncertainties:" / "Assumptions:"
- "Alternative: If **[contrary condition]**, then **[implication]**."

## Common Pitfalls (AVOID)
- Burying the lead; starting with methods/history
- "Data dumps" that do not answer the decision question
- Policy prescriptions (your job is to assess, not recommend policy)
- Over-certainty; failing to mark confidence and assumptions

## Pre-Write Checklist
- [ ] Who is my reader? What decision/problem are they facing today?
- [ ] What do they need to know vs nice-to-know?
- [ ] What do they already know (avoid re-teaching history)?
- [ ] One-line BLUF drafted before body text
- [ ] Two-three key points that prove the BLUF
- [ ] One paragraph on implications + indicators
