# CLAUDE.md

## Project
- **Name:** CyberBRIEF
- **Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, FastAPI, Python 3.11
- **Root:** This directory
- **Deploy:** Railway (project: compassionate-rejoicing)

## Architecture
- Frontend: `frontend/` (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand)
- Backend: `backend/` (FastAPI + Python 3.11)
- Docs: `docs/` (BLUF style guide, citation style, deployment)

## Build & Test
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Build frontend
cd frontend && npx vite build
```

## Key Files
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - React entry with router
- `backend/app.py` - FastAPI entry point (or main.py)
- `BLUF_STYLE_GUIDE.md` - Writing style for briefings
- `CITATION_STYLE.md` - Source citation format
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deploy instructions
- `railway.json` - Railway config

## Gotchas
- **Use `npx vite build`** (not `tsc && vite build`). TypeScript compiler fails but Vite builds fine.
- **Zustand for state** (unlike other projects which use custom stores).
- **BLUF format:** Bottom Line Up Front. Briefings lead with the conclusion, then supporting details.

## Style Guide
- Dark theme, cybersecurity aesthetic
- No em dashes. Ever.
- BLUF writing style for all generated content
- Citations follow CITATION_STYLE.md format

## DO NOT
- Run `tsc` standalone (it fails, use `npx vite build` directly)
- Change the BLUF writing format (it's the core product identity)

## Git Rules
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- Never add Co-Authored-By lines or mention AI in commits
- No em dashes in commit messages

## OpenClaw Sync Protocol

An AI assistant (clawdbot) runs in OpenClaw and manages this workspace. OpenClaw on Rocinante is the canonical long-term memory. Claude Code may keep local or session memory, but durable knowledge must flow back through Memory Handoffs.

### After completing a substantial task

If you learned anything durable, create a Memory Handoff in:

```text
.claude/memory-handoffs/
```

Use the standard format documented in:

```text
~/.openclaw/workspace/docs/claude-code-memory-handoff.md
```

### Durable knowledge includes
- architecture decisions
- workflow changes
- root causes and non-obvious fixes
- setup and environment gotchas
- security findings
- reusable commands and patterns
- durable research findings
- user preferences or working conventions

### Rules
1. Do not wait to be reminded. If the work produced durable knowledge, write the handoff automatically.
2. Be specific. Name files, commands, errors, and the actual decision made.
3. Do not edit `MEMORY.md` directly. OpenClaw curates long-term memory.
4. Do not write directly into random memory files. Use the handoff path so Rocinante can ingest and route it cleanly.
5. Commit and push your work normally. The handoff complements git history. It does not replace it.
