# Citation Style Guide: Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (Notes-Bibliography)

Reference: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/cmos_formatting_and_style_guide/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html

## System: Notes-Bibliography (NB)

CyberBRIEF uses the Chicago NB system exclusively. This means:
- **Footnotes/endnotes** for in-text citations (superscript numbers)
- **Bibliography** section at the end of every report

## Notes (Footnotes/Endnotes)

- Each source reference gets a superscript number in the text
- The note contains bibliographic info for that source
- First citation of a source: full details
- Subsequent citations of the same source: shortened form (author surname, shortened title, page)
- Consecutive same-source citations: may use "Ibid." (discouraged by CMOS 17th but acceptable)

### Note Format Examples

**Book:**
1. Author First Last, *Title of Book* (Place: Publisher, Year), page.

**Journal Article:**
2. Author First Last, "Article Title," *Journal Name* Volume, no. Issue (Year): page.

**Website/Online Source:**
3. Author First Last, "Page Title," Organization/Website, Month Day, Year, URL.

**Web Source (no author):**
4. "Page Title," Organization, accessed Month Day, Year, URL.

**Government/Institutional Report:**
5. Organization, *Report Title* (Location: Publisher, Year), page.

**Shortened form (subsequent citations):**
6. Last, "Short Title," page.

## Implementation Notes for CyberBRIEF

1. Reports render footnote superscript numbers in body text
2. Endnotes section appears before the Bibliography
3. Bibliography is the final section of every report
4. Sources from Brave Search / Perplexity citations must be reformatted into Chicago NB style
5. When author is unknown (common for security advisories), use organization name or "Page Title" format
6. Access dates are required for all web sources
7. PDF exports must preserve footnote numbering and bibliography formatting
